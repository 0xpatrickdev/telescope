## Quickstart

Follow the instructions below to kick off your Telescope module.

```sh
npm install -g @osmonauts/telescope
```

### Generate

Use the `generate` command to create a new repository with the default proto files. 

```sh
telescope generate
cd ./your-new-project
yarn 
```
### Install

To install chain protobufs, run the `install` command. 

```sh
telescope install
```

It's not necessary, but you may also specify specific packages, e.g.

```sh
telescope install @protobufs/osmosis
```

### Transpile

To create the Typescript files, run the `transpile` command. 

```sh
telescope transpile
```

You should now seem some `.ts` files generated in `./src`. These are the real source files used in your application.

### Build

Finally, run `install` and `buidl` to generate the JS and types for publishing your module to npm.

```sh
yarn install
yarn buidl
```
