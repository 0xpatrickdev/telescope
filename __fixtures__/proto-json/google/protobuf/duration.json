It is independent of any calendar and concepts like \"day\"\nor \"month\". It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between\ntwo Timestamp values is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted\nfrom a Timestamp. Range is approximately +-10,000 years.\n\n# Examples\n\nExample 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.\n\nTimestamp start = ...;\nTimestamp end = ...;\nDuration duration = ...;\n\nduration.seconds = end.seconds - start.seconds;\nduration.nanos = end.nanos - start.nanos;\n\nif (duration.seconds < 0 && duration.nanos > 0) {\nduration.seconds += 1;\nduration.nanos -= 1000000000;\n} else if (durations.seconds > 0 && duration.nanos < 0) {\nduration.seconds -= 1;\nduration.nanos += 1000000000;\n}\n\nExample 2: Compute Timestamp from Timestamp + Duration in pseudo code.\n\nTimestamp start = ...;\nDuration duration = ...;\nTimestamp end = ...;\n\nend.seconds = start.seconds + duration.seconds;\nend.nanos = start.nanos + duration.nanos;\n\nif (end.nanos < 0) {\nend.seconds -= 1;\nend.nanos += 1000000000;\n} else if (end.nanos >= 1000000000) {\nend.seconds += 1;\nend.nanos -= 1000000000;\n}\n\nExample 3: Compute Duration from datetime.timedelta in Python.\n\ntd = datetime.timedelta(days=3, minutes=10)\nduration = Duration()\nduration.FromTimedelta(td)\n\n# JSON Mapping\n\nIn JSON format, the Duration type is encoded as a string rather than an\nobject, where the string ends in the suffix \"s\" (indicating seconds) and\nis preceded by the number of seconds, with nanoseconds expressed as\nfractional seconds. For example, 3 seconds with 0 nanoseconds should be\nencoded in JSON format as \"3s\", while 3 seconds and 1 nanosecond should\nbe expressed in JSON format as \"3.000000001s\", and 3 seconds and 1\nmicrosecond should be expressed in JSON format as \"3.000001s\"."
